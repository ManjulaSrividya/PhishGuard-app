## 🔐 PhishGuard App – ML Based Phishing Website Detection System

PhishGuard is an intelligent web application that detects phishing websites using machine learning techniques. The application analyzes a given website URL and predicts whether it is **legitimate or phishing**, helping users stay safe from online fraud and malicious attacks.

With the increasing number of cyber threats and fake websites, phishing has become one of the most common methods used by attackers to steal sensitive information. PhishGuard addresses this problem by providing a simple, fast, and reliable solution that leverages machine learning to identify suspicious websites in real time.
